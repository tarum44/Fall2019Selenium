// casting the WebDriver instance to a JavaScriptExecutor

JavascriptExecutor js=(JavascriptExecutor) driver;

// JavascriptExecutor interface provides the executeScript() method to which we need
// to pass the JavaScript code

String title = (String) js.executeScript("return document.title");

JavaScriptExecutor -- interface that allows to execute JavaScript code as a part of our selenium script

JavaScript -- used for front-end development, and supported by every browser and website. If, something doesn't work
in selenium, we can do it with JavaScriptExecutor. For example: click, scroll, text input.
